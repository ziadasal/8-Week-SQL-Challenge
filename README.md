# 8-Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to my 8-Week SQL Challenge repository! Here, I'm documenting my journey as I tackle the challenges using T-SQL and SQL Server. This repository serves as a record of my progress, solutions, and insights gained during this learning experience.

## Challenge Overview

### **Week 1: Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner**

**Challenge Introduction:**
Danny is passionate about Japanese food and opened Danny's Diner in early 2021, offering his favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. However, Danny needs assistance in leveraging the data collected from his restaurant's operations to make informed decisions and enhance the customer experience.

**Problem Statement:**
For this challenge, I worked with three key datasets provided by Danny:
- `sales`: Contains data related to customer visits, including dates, customer IDs, and menu items.
- `menu`: Contains information about the menu items.
- `members`: Provides details about the restaurant's loyalty program members.

**My Approach:**
I crafted SQL queries to answer Danny's questions, such as understanding customer visiting patterns, calculating their expenditures, and identifying their favorite menu items. This analysis will enable Danny to make data-driven decisions regarding his loyalty program and streamline data inspection for his team.

### **Week 2: Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner**

**Challenge Introduction:**
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza are consumed daily worldwide? Danny, inspired by the idea of combining 80s retro styling with pizza, launched Pizza Runner. However, to attract seed funding and expand his Pizza Empire, he needed to optimize his operations and streamline delivery services.

**Available Data:**
For this challenge, I worked with the pizza_runner database schema, containing datasets crucial for Danny's business. These datasets include information about orders, runners, and customers, as well as an entity relationship diagram guiding the database design.

**My Approach:**
I utilized SQL to clean and analyze the data, applying basic calculations to assist Danny in directing his runners efficiently and optimizing Pizza Runner's operations. By doing so, I aimed to contribute to the growth of Danny's unique pizza delivery venture.

### **Week 3: Case Study #3 - Foodie Fi**
